    <h1> collectively imagining radical post-abolition futures </h1>

    <h5> "What shall we build on the ashes of a nightmare?" - Robin D.G. Kelley </h5>
    <p> This webpage was created in the soon to be historic era of 2020, when the global
    pandemic surfaced not only in the form of a diease that attacks the respiratory system, but also as the increased visability of a long standing system of racialized oppression and violence.
    When Americans heard George Floyd gasp the words "I can't breathe", the last words that Eric Garner had also utter before his murder at the hands of police in 2015, chaos erupted worldwide. This renewed chaos that couldn't possibly be ignored. We burned the Minneapolis 3rd precinct to the ground overnight, truly showing that the current systems in power can and will be broken. This webpage acts as both a whimsical archival personal reflection and an effort to connect with communuties to discuss how we might attain a future in which we have successfully dismantled the carceral state. </p>
