    <h1> collectively imagining radical post-abolition futures </h1>
    <br>
    <h5> "What shall we build on the ashes of a nightmare?" - Robin D.G. Kelley </h5>
    <br>
    <p> This webpage was created in the soon to be historic era of 2020, when the global
    pandemic surfaced not only in the form of a diease that attacks the respiratory system, but also as the increased visability of a long standing system of racialized oppression and violence.
    When Americans heard George Floyd gasp the words "I can't breathe", the last words that Eric Garner had also uttered before his murder at the hands of police in 2015, chaos erupted worldwide. This renewed chaos can't possibly be overlooked. As the Minneapolis 3rd precinct burned to the ground overnight, the people proved that the current systems in power can and will be broken. This webpage is not meant to act as exhaustive resource, but rather a reflection and archive of the times in the form of net art. It also materializes as an effort to connect with communuties to share resources and discuss how we might attain a future in which we have successfully dismantled the carceral state. </p>
